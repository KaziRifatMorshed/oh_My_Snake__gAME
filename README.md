# oh_My_Snake__gAME
this is a terminal-based snake game with overlapping features (aye aye captain, let's cheat) [it was fun BTW] and window rewinding...made in C as a hobby [it was my first project BTW].....

to play...  
download all files (don't ask how), and then open your LINUX terminal and write `./ohMySnake_gAMe` which will execute the game ............
